This folder contains everything regarding the PCB. Furthermore there will be mounting hardware for DIN Rails in the mounting folder.

## PCB Production/Assembly

I recoment only getting the PCB manufactured and then poppulating the board yourself. There are not SMD parts on the PCB so assembly isn't as cheap as you are probably used to. Due to it's non smd nature sodering should be easy and replacing parts (maybe because they corrode in you greenhouse) is very simple and easy to pull of.

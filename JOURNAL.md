## 29th May (1h)

Finding 3D Models for electrical box and other parts. It actually took some time to find a 3D model of the electrical Box I want to repurpose for the project. And because I am sometimes a lazy person [here its more about effectiveness; who needs to design a box when manufacturues profide the files :)] But from my experiente they like to hide them.

I eventually found the .stp files I was searching for and imported them into Fusion 360. Looks great and will defenitly better visualize the Idea and is perfect for planning.

### Session 1 (1h 30m)

I just worte some imortant stuff to the README and build a logical project structure. The README also explains the concept of sensor modules. The concept of sensor moduels I introduced makes it easy to adapt and adjust the project to you individual needs. I added a License fole just to be clear on how the project can be used in the future.

### Session 2 (2h)

I modeled some parts on my own like the ground plate on the inside of the box where everything is mounted. Furthermore I added the main switch and DIN Rais inside the box with some terminals for the wires.

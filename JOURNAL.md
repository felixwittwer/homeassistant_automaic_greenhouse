Finding 3D Models for electrical box and other parts. It actually took some time to find a 3D model of the electrical Box I want to repurpose for the project. And because I am sometimes a lazy person [here its more about effectiveness; who needs to design a box when manufacturues profide the files :)] But from my experiente they like to hide them.

I eventually found the .stp files I was searching for and imported them into Fusion 360. Looks great and will defenitly better visualize the Idea and is perfect for planning.

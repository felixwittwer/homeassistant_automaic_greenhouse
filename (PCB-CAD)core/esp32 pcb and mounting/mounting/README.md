# PCB mounting

This folder contains the Hardware for mounting the PCB to a DIN rail.

## 3D printing

The design works totally fine with my SLA printer and Anycubig tough resin. You might need to think about placing your supports and material choices. The tough resin I use is a bit elastik so the clips dont snap of and can be bend temporarily during assembly.

STL Files are inside this folder.

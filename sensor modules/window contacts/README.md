# window contacts

For sensing the state of the windows on the greenhouse reed switches and magnets will be used to build custom window contacts. When integrated in Homeassistant the window will only have two states: **opened/closed**. The contacts are specially designed for my greenhouse so you will probably need to adjust the files to your needs.

## 3D printing

The desing works totally fine with my SLA printer and Anycubig tough resin. You might need to think about placing your supports and material choices. The tough resin I use is a bit elastik so the clips dont snap of and can be bend temporarily during assembly.
